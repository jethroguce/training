    "> An important part of programming is, of course, making a program that does what it’s supposed to do. In other words, it should have no bugs. You know all this. However, focusing on correctness, on bug-free programs, misses a lot of what programming is all about. Programming is not just about the end product; it’s about the process that gets you there. \n",

    "\n",

    "> Probably the first, most basic rule of good programming is to avoid duplication of code at all costs. This is sometimes called the DRY rule: Don’t Repeat Yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I usually think of it in another way: a good programmer cultivates the virtue of laziness. Save yourself work whenever possible. If making a few changes now means you’ll be able to save yourself more work later, do it! Make your program a place where you can do the absolute minimum amount of work to get the job done. Not only is programming this way much more interesting (it’s very boring to do the same thing over and over and over...), but it produces less buggy code, and it produces it faster. It’s a win-win-win situation."
